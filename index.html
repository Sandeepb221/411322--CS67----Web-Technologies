          <h1>Technical portfolio built for CS67 assessment evidence</h1>
          <p>
            This website is created as part of the CS67 Web Technologies coursework. It demonstrates semantic HTML
            structure, responsive CSS layout, and JavaScript-based interaction. The design follows a professional
            “technical resume” style so that an assessor can quickly evaluate learning outcomes without distraction.

            The portfolio is structured to support marking: clear sections, documented features, and simple interactive
            elements that demonstrate core web development skills required in CS67.

        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          I am Sandeep MOLLETI. This portfolio demonstrates my practical understanding of core front-end web technologies.
          The aim is to present work in a way that is academically clear, easy to evaluate, and suitable for viva discussion.
          The website is intentionally framework-free to show direct competency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>

        <div class="grid2">
          <article class="card">
            <h3>Design rationale</h3>
            <p>
              A technical resume theme is selected because it prioritises readability, structured information, and assessment
              clarity. The interface uses restrained colour accents and consistent spacing to maintain a professional tone
              suitable for academic submission.
            </p>
          </article>

          <article class="card">
            <h3>What the assessor should notice</h3>
            <p>
              Each section maps to a learning outcome: semantic structure, responsive layout, controlled interactivity,
              validation, and testing evidence. Interactive features are intentionally simple but meaningful, which supports
              reliability and clear explanation during the presentation.

    <!-- SKILLS (Accordion) -->
    <section id="skills" class="section soft">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Skills (Accordion Demonstration)</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This section uses an accordion component to demonstrate JavaScript event handling and DOM state changes.
          Clicking each header expands or collapses the related content. The written content is coursework-focused and
          describes how each skill area is applied in this portfolio.
        </p>

        <div class="accordion" id="skillsAcc">
          <div class="acc-item">
            <button class="acc-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">
              HTML — semantics, structure, accessibility
            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                Semantic tags are used to structure the website, including header/navigation, main content sections, and a
                footer. Proper heading hierarchy improves readability and supports assistive technology. Labels are applied
                to form controls to ensure the interface remains accessible and academically appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                This directly supports CS67 requirements related to correct document structure, accessibility principles,
                and maintainable code organisation.

            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                CSS is used to create a consistent visual system: reusable cards, buttons, spacing rules, and typographic
                hierarchy. Grid and flexible layouts are used so the site adapts to mobile screens without breaking content
                flow. The design remains readable and stable across different devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is assessed through responsiveness, design coherence, and appropriate use of layout techniques.

              JavaScript — interaction and user feedback
            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                JavaScript powers the accordion behaviour, mobile navigation toggling, scroll-spy highlighting, and contact
                form validation. These features demonstrate event listeners, DOM selection, conditional logic, and dynamic UI
                updates without reliance on external libraries.
              </p>
              <p>
                The code is intentionally readable and structured so it can be explained clearly in a viva.

    <section id="evidence" class="section">
      <div class="wrap">
        <h2>Evidence of Coursework Requirements</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          This section provides assessable evidence aligned with the CS67 learning outcomes. Each evidence item explains what
          was implemented, why it was implemented, and how it supports usability and academic marking. The accordion format
          keeps content structured and readable.
        </p>

        <div class="accordion" id="evidenceAcc">
          <div class="acc-item">
            <button class="acc-btn" type="button" aria-expanded="false">
              Evidence 1 — Semantic page layout and navigation
            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                The portfolio uses semantic HTML sections and navigation anchors so users can move between content areas
                quickly. This supports both user experience and assessment review, since an assessor can locate evidence
                without scrolling through unrelated content.
              </p>
              <p>
                The navigation is paired with scroll-spy highlighting to show active position, demonstrating a practical
                JavaScript enhancement that improves clarity during review.
              </p>
            </div>

            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                Content is displayed using a card-based layout that adapts from multi-column desktop views to stacked mobile
                views using media queries. Spacing and typography rules are consistent, which supports readability and gives
                the site a professional academic tone.
              </p>
              <p>
                The responsive design is verified in the testing section using manual checks across multiple screen widths.

            </button>
            <div class="acc-panel" hidden>
              <p>
                JavaScript interaction is implemented in four areas: mobile menu toggle, accordion behaviour, scroll-spy
                navigation, and contact form validation. Validation checks help ensure data quality by verifying name length,
                email format, and message length before acceptance.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are assessed as functional interaction features that demonstrate DOM manipulation and user feedback.

        <p class="lead">
          This testing summary documents how the portfolio was checked during development. Testing focuses on responsive

            <h3>Responsiveness checks</h3>
            <p>
              The website was tested using browser developer tools at multiple widths (desktop, tablet, and mobile). The
              layout was verified to ensure cards stack correctly, text remains readable, and navigation stays accessible
              without horizontal scrolling.

            <h3>JavaScript behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              Accordion panels were tested for correct expand/collapse behaviour, ensuring only the intended panel opens at a
              time. The scroll-spy navigation highlight was verified while scrolling. The mobile menu toggle was tested for
              open/close stability across device sizes.

          <article class="card">
            <h3>Form validation</h3>
            <p>
              The form was tested with empty fields, invalid emails, and short messages to confirm error messages display
              clearly. Valid entries were tested to confirm the success message appears and the form resets for demo purposes.
